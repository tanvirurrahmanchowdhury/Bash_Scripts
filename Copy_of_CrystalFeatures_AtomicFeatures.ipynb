To demonstrate the placement of code here, check out the below section. This is some python code that prints out the text `\"Hello material science!\"`.

        "Before we start ML, let’s address a very important question that lies at the centre of the field of ML-driven material discovery: **how do we apply ML to predict crystal properties?**\n",
        "\n",
        "First, **what are crystal properties?** These are quantities that are measured or calculated for crystals. By crystal, I mean a structure that is endowed with **periodicity**. Let’s take the example of **diamond**. This material has just one atom, carbon (C). If you could zoom-in very close into diamond such that you can see the C atoms (people sort of do that using advanced experimental techniques by the way), you will see something similar to the following figure.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Left: the diamond unit cell. Right: infinitely repeating the unit cell in the three directions gives us the diamond crystal.](https://sheriftawfikabbas.github.io/images/diamond.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The figure illustrates how a diamond crystal is created from the **diamond unit cell**, which is the little molecule on the left with 4 C atoms. The crystal has **infinitely many diamond unit cells* along the three directions, so it is a 3D pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we discuss crystals further, consider molecules for a minute. Molecules are **fundamentally different** from crystals because of the pattern (periodicity) bit: a molecule is just that one single molecule, sitting on its own, in isolation, whereas a crystal is really composed of an infinite number of molecules. How would the pattern in the crystal make ML for molecules different from ML for crystals?\n",
        "\n",
        "To predict the properties of the molecules one can derive a set of descriptors for the molecules in the data set that are based on the **positions of the atoms within the molecule**. One can derive descriptors based on the relative positions, in order to ensure that the descriptors are **invariant to transformations**: rotation and translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key thing here in the molecular descriptors is that they are **based on the atomic positions**. In crystals, **we can't really use atomic positions** like we did with molecules to obtain descriptors. Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about the diamond crystal pattern above. Because it is a pattern, it is **symmetric in all three directions**. Now let's say we are going to calculate the Coulomb matrix for diamond, so we start with the positions of the atoms in the unit cell of diamond, that figure on the left. But wait: even though these four atoms do form a valid unit cell for diamond, we can also come up with another valid unit cell, as shown below.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Another possible structure for the diamond unit cell.](https://sheriftawfikabbas.github.io/images/diamon_alternative_unit_cell.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The figure above is also valid. How to obtain it? Look at the diamond crystal in Figure 1, and take a different repeating unit from it. As long as this repeating unit can also form the same pattern, it is a valid unit cell!\n",
        "\n",
        "So, there are many different ways we can represent the unit cell of a crystal. Therefore, we cannot use the atomic coordinates to derive descriptors for crystals, otherwise the derived descriptors, such as the eigenvalues of the Coulomb matrix in the case of molecules, will **change dramatically for the same crystal**. That is, **the descriptor vector is not invariant with respect to translation of the unit cell**. What do we do then?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Building a simple descriptor vector for crystals\n",
        "\n",
        "A possible solution to this problem is to use some statistics of atomic properties as the descriptor vector. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Average of the atomic numbers of all the elements in the crystal. For example, in silicon carbide, SiC, the average value would be the average of 14 (for Si) and 6 (for C), which is (14 + 6)/2 = 10. So that's now one number in the descriptor vector.\n",
        "- The average of the ionization potential of the atoms\n",
        "- The average of the electron affinity of the atoms\n",
        "- And more averages\n",
        "\n",
        "So we can keep adding averages of properties to this list, to expand the descriptor vector. This vector will not suffer from the lack of invariance issue pointed out above, because these are average values of quantities that do not depend on the geometry of the crystal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Average is just one statistic. We can also add other statistics, such as the standard deviation and the variance. Adding those will triple the number elements in the descriptor vector above.\n",
